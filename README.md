A system monitor for the web. Data is read with rust, and displayed on the browser via HTML canvas.

Inspired by [fasterthanlime/axact](https://github.com/fasterthanlime/axact). Main differences are reading more information, persisting history, and the whole React client side. Also, the websocket implementation was removed as it doesn't justify itself.
